Before diving into strategies, it's essential to understand how V-Bucks function in Fortnite:

- **Primary Use**: V-Bucks can be used to buy cosmetics, Battle Passes, and even gifting items to friends.
- **Sources**: They can be obtained through gameplay, purchasing directly, or promotional events.
- **Value**: 1,000 V-Bucks typically cost $7.99 USD, but rates vary by region and promotions.

2. **High Yield**: On specific days, rewards can be as high as 800 V-Bucks.
